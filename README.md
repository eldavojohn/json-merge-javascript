# json-merge-javascript
A dead simple project for merging JSON objects in JavaScript.  It concatenates strings, adds numbers and merges subobjects.  It allows you to ignore properties as well in order to prevent that and take the base value.

# Usage in Node
Run
```
make tests
```
To see the tests run in test/main/js/merge-tests.js and check out the code in those to get an idea of how to use this simple library.
